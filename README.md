NumPy is a Python library thatâ€™s used in almost every field of science and engineering. 
Itâ€™s practically THE standard for working with numerical data in Python. 
The case studies for how NumPy is being used speak for themselves ðŸ˜®

Pandas which is built on top of NumPy. Think of Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool that includes functionality for working with time-series or for grouping, joining, merging and finding missing data . 
NumPy on the other hand shines with low-level tasks, like doing serious math and calculations.
